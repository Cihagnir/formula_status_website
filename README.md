# Frontend Project - Formula One Timing Data

## Overview

This is the frontend of the Formula One Timing Data website, built using React and TypeScript. The website features several pages, including Home, About, and Graph, offering users access to Formula One timing data in a graphical interface. The frontend will be deployed on Amazon AWS.

## Basic Code Rules

These parts explain the code standards to follow. While not conventional, they aim to be as clear as possible.

1. **Snake Case for Main Usage**:

   - External libraries should remain distinct.

2. **Use 2-Space Tabs**:

   - To accommodate varying screen widths.

3. **Descriptive Variable Names**:

   - Variable names should be clear and self-explanatory, without being overly verbose.

4. **User Type Indications**:

   - Example: `status_controller_interface`, `xxx_xxx_struct`

5. **Variable Type Indications**:

   - Example: `default_input_json`, `session_year_int`

6. **Function Naming**:

   - Function names should start with a capital letter.
   - Example: `Sql_Data_Retriever`, `User_Selection_Handler`
